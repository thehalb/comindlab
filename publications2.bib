	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to inspire team research to apply diverse and unconventional perspectives to study team dynamics and performance in healthcare settings. To illustrate that using multiple perspectives can yield valuable insights, we examine a segment of a team interaction during a heart-surgery, using five distinct interdisciplinary perspectives known from small group research: the psychodynamic, functional, conflict-power-status, temporal, and social identity perspectives. We briefly describe each theoretical perspective, discuss its application to study healthcare teams, and present possible research questions for the segment at hand using the respective perspective. We also highlight the benefits and challenges associated with employing these diverse approaches and explore how they can be integrated to analyze team processes in health care. Finally, we offer our own insights and opinions on the integration of these approaches, as well as the types of data required to conduct such analyses. We also point to further research avenues and highlight the benefits associated with employing these diverse approaches.

              When making complex decisions, such as a medical diagnosis, decision makers typically gather, analyze, and synthesize (integrate) information. In a previous study, we showed that delegating such complex decisions to collaborating pairs increases decision quality substantially compared to that of individuals, without requiring different information gathering. Given the higher costs associated with teamwork, however, it is of great practical interest to understand when in the process the performance benefits of teams may arise, so that particular subtasks can be delegated to teams when most appropriate. We thus conducted an experimental study in which fourth‐year medical students (
              n
               = 109) worked either in pairs or alone on two separate subtasks of the diagnostic process: (1) analyzing diagnostic test results (e.g., X‐rays) and (2) integrating previously interpreted test results into diagnoses. Linear mixed‐effects models revealed a small benefit of collaborating pairs over individuals in both subtasks. We conclude that collaborating with a peer may pay off both when analyzing information
              and
              when integrating it into a diagnosis as it provides the opportunity to correct each other's errors and to make use of a greater knowledge base. These findings encourage the strategic use of collaboration with a colleague when making complex decisions. Further research into the underlying processes is needed.},

              Introduction
              For researchers and medical simulation trainers, measuring team dynamics is vital for providing targeted feedback that can lead to improved patient outcomes. It is also valuable for research, such as investigating which dynamics benefit team performance. Traditional assessment methods, such as questionnaires and observations, are often subjective and static, lacking the ability to capture team dynamics. To address these shortcomings, this study explores the use of physiological synchrony (PS) measured through electrocardiogram (ECG) data to evaluate team dynamics automated and in high-resolution.
            
            
              Methods
              A multicentre observational field study was conducted involving 214 medical first responders during mixed reality (MR) mass casualty training sessions. Participants were equipped with electrocardiogram (ECG) sensors and MR gear. The study measured dyadic PS using heart rate (HR), root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), and standard deviation of NN intervals (SDNN). Data were collected at high frequency and analysed using dynamic time warping (dtw) to assess fluctuations in PS.
            
            
              Results
              Findings indicate that PS varies significantly by task nature, with higher synchrony during cooperative tasks compared to baseline. Different ECG metrics offered unique insights into team dynamics. Proximity and scenario conditions influenced PS, with closer teamwork leading to higher PS. Smaller sampling intervals (e.g. 5 s) provided a detailed view of PS fluctuations over time.
            
            
              Discussion
              The results demonstrate the potential of PS as an indicator of team performance and cohesion. High-resolution monitoring provides detailed insights into team dynamics, offering high-resolution feedback that traditional methods cannot provide. The integration of physiological measures into training programmes can enhance team performance by providing objective, high-resolution data.
            
            
              Conclusion
              This study shows that PS, measured by ECG data, is sensitive to medical team activities, offering insights into team dynamics. Different ECG metrics highlight various aspects of team performance, and high-resolution monitoring captures detailed dynamics. Further research is needed to validate these findings across diverse scenarios. This approach could improve training methodologies, resulting in better-prepared medical teams and improved patient care outcomes.},

	abstract = {Introduction
              Versatile large language models (LLMs) have the potential to augment diagnostic decision-making by assisting diagnosticians, thanks to their ability to engage in open-ended, natural conversations and their comprehensive knowledge access. Yet the novelty of LLMs in diagnostic decision-making introduces uncertainties regarding their impact. Clinicians unfamiliar with the use of LLMs in their professional context may rely on general attitudes towards LLMs more broadly, potentially hindering thoughtful use and critical evaluation of their input, leading to either over-reliance and lack of critical thinking or an unwillingness to use LLMs as diagnostic aids. To address these concerns, this study examines the influence on the diagnostic process and outcomes of interacting with an LLM compared with a human coach, and of prior training vs no training for interacting with either of these ‘coaches’. Our findings aim to illuminate the potential benefits and risks of employing artificial intelligence (AI) in diagnostic decision-making.
            
            
              Methods and analysis
              We are conducting a prospective, randomised experiment with N=158 fourth-year medical students from Charité Medical School, Berlin, Germany. Participants are asked to diagnose patient vignettes after being assigned to either a human coach or ChatGPT and after either training or no training (both between-subject factors). We are specifically collecting data on the effects of using either of these ‘coaches’ and of additional training on information search, number of hypotheses entertained, diagnostic accuracy and confidence. Statistical methods will include linear mixed effects models. Exploratory analyses of the interaction patterns and attitudes towards AI will also generate more generalisable knowledge about the role of AI in medicine.
