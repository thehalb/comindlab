abstract: Abstract  Introduction For researchers and medical simulation trainers,
  measuring team dynamics is vital for providing targeted feedback that can lead to
  improved patient outcomes. It is also valuable for research, such as investigating
  which dynamics benefit team performance. Traditional assessment methods, such as
  questionnaires and observations, are often subjective and static, lacking the ability
  to capture team dynamics. To address these shortcomings, this study explores the
  use of physiological synchrony (PS) measured through electrocardiogram (ECG) data
  to evaluate team dynamics automated and in high-resolution.   Methods A multicentre
  observational field study was conducted involving 214 medical first responders during
  mixed reality (MR) mass casualty training sessions. Participants were equipped with
  electrocardiogram (ECG) sensors and MR gear. The study measured dyadic PS using
  heart rate (HR), root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), and standard
  deviation of NN intervals (SDNN). Data were collected at high frequency and analysed
  using dynamic time warping (dtw) to assess fluctuations in PS.   Results Findings
  indicate that PS varies significantly by task nature, with higher synchrony during
  cooperative tasks compared to baseline. Different ECG metrics offered unique insights
  into team dynamics. Proximity and scenario conditions influenced PS, with closer
  teamwork leading to higher PS. Smaller sampling intervals (e.g. 5 s) provided a
  detailed view of PS fluctuations over time.   Discussion The results demonstrate
  the potential of PS as an indicator of team performance and cohesion. High-resolution
  monitoring provides detailed insights into team dynamics, offering high-resolution
  feedback that traditional methods cannot provide. The integration of physiological
  measures into training programmes can enhance team performance by providing objective,
  high-resolution data.   Conclusion This study shows that PS, measured by ECG data,
  is sensitive to medical team activities, offering insights into team dynamics. Different
  ECG metrics highlight various aspects of team performance, and high-resolution monitoring
  captures detailed dynamics. Further research is needed to validate these findings
  across diverse scenarios. This approach could improve training methodologies, resulting
  in better-prepared medical teams and improved patient care outcomes.
